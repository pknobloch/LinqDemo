# The evolution of C# to support LinQ

This project is intended to be a demonstration based on this article: [The Evolution Of LINQ And Its Impact On The Design Of C#](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163400.aspx).

After explaining the language features needed, there are some examples of how Linq handles deferred execution and a few samples to show how it compares to SQL.

The project has been updated to use .Net 6 with one or two C# 10 features.

This project has been updated to include examples copied and slightly modified from a series of articles titled ["From Test Data Builders to the identity functor"](https://blog.ploeh.dk/2017/08/14/from-test-data-builders-to-the-identity-functor/) by Mark Seemann.
